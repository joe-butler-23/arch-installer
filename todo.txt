- Need to deal with the hyprland.conf issue whereit automatically updates itself
- Part of the process will include AI checking the log for the install to see if amends are required
- CHeck the current approach against requirements from previous implementations and start testing on desktop
- Can I save stuff like my bluetooth configs?
- Get UWSM set up as part of install 

## Post-install tasks for desktop setup
- [ ] Enable SSH service on fresh desktop (sudo systemctl enable sshd && sudo systemctl start sshd)
- [ ] Configure firewall to allow SSH (sudo ufw allow ssh), maybe have this as a post install script
- [ ] Add section on manual post-install steps for packages and dotfiles
